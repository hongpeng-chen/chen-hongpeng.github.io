I am **Hongpeng Chen**, a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Pai Zheng](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/ise/people/academic-staff/pai-zheng/) and [Prof. David Navarro-Alarcon](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/people/academic-teaching-staff/david-navarro-alarcon-prof/).

My research interests include **robotics**, **machine learning**, and **computer vision**, with a focus on:
- Human-robot collaboration  
- Robot perception and learning  
- Task and motion planning  

During my Ph.D. study, I have also received guidance from [Prof. Lihui Wang](https://www.kth.se/profile/lihuiw) and [Prof. Charlie Yang](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/people/charlie-yang).
